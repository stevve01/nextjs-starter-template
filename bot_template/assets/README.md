# Assets Directory

This directory is meant to store the welcome photo for the bot.

## Required Files:
- `photo.jpg` - The welcome photo that will be shown when users start the bot (/start command)

## Instructions:
1. Place your welcome photo in this directory
2. Name it exactly as "photo.jpg"
3. Make sure the photo is:
   - In JPG/JPEG format
   - Of reasonable size (recommended: under 2MB)
   - Has appropriate dimensions for Telegram (recommended: 1280x720 pixels)

Note: If no photo is provided, the bot will still work but will only send the welcome text without an image.
